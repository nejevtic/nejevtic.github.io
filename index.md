Hi everybody! I am happy to see you here. I've been around for some time, and I am slowly migrating my digital self from on-prem infra to public web. Seems it is going to take a while as I am doing it on Web2 :) My offline self lives in Switzerland, enjoys mostly his family and a few friends and hobbies I have. On the other hand, my digital self is a DevOps engineer trying to automate the things that will enable content to thrive, and us automation guys to find new hobbies. If you would like to collaborate with me on an interesting idea, please contact me and let's talk. My human self is looking forward to that :)
